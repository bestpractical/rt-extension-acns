NAME
    RT::Extension::ACNS - parse ACNS messages and extract info into custom
    fields

DESCRIPTION
    ACNS stands for Automated Copyright Notice System. It's an open source,
    royalty free system that universities, ISP's, or anyone that handles
    large volumes of copyright notices can implement on their network to
    increase the efficiency and reduce the costs of responding to the
    notices... See <http://mpto.unistudios.com/xml/> for more details.

    This extension for RT is a configurable scrip that parses ACNS XML from
    incomming messages and stores it in custom fields.

RT VERSION
    Works with RT 4.0 and RT 4.2.
